# Pacific Boat Club

Welcome to the Pacific Boat Club repository! Pacific Boat Club is a professional application designed for viewing boats and accessing information about members interested in listing their boats for sale. With this app, users can sign up as new members, list their boats, and manage their boat listings.

# Instructions

To get the front end up and running, follow these steps:

Fork and clone the repository.
Navigate to the client folder.
Install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components
npm install @mui/icons-material
npm install formik
npm install yup 
```


Once you are on the Pacific Boat Club application page, users can sign up and create a unique username and password. When signing up, users can also provide their name and biography, which will be displayed on the members' page. After logging in, users have the ability to edit their own listings and delete them. If a user is not logged in, they can still browse boats and members, but they won't have editing capabilities. The boats page also features a search functionality, allowing users to search for specific makes or models of boats.
